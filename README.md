# Maven-Market-Dashboard
During my Power BI course by Maven Analytics , I created an interactive Power BI report for Maven Market. Connected and cleaned multiple CSV files, built data relationships, and developed DAX measures. The report includes KPIs, maps, and charts, highlighting sales, returns, and revenue trends.

Problem Statement for Power BI Project

The retail chain Maven Market faces challenges in managing and interpreting its extensive sales data, which spans across multiple years and includes various customer demographics, product lines, and regional performance metrics. The company needs a comprehensive and dynamic reporting solution to consolidate data from multiple sources, provide actionable insights, and support data-driven decision-making. The goal of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI report that integrates customer, product, store, region, calendar, returns, and transaction data to track key performance indicators, identify trends, and optimize business strategies.
